/*

A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula and one (or some) 
starting states. A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously found ones. 

DP solutions have a polynomial complexity which assures a much faster running time than other 
techniques like backtracking, brute-force etc.

/*
What does a "state" stand for? 

It's a way to describe a situation, a sub-solution for the problem.

 For example a state would be the solution for sum i, where iâ‰¤S. 
 A smaller state than state i would be the solution for any sum j, where j<i. 

 For finding a state i, we need to first find all smaller states j (j<i) . 

 Having found the minimum number of coins which sum up to i, we can easily find the next state 
 - the solution for i+1. 

Set Min[i] equal to Infinity for all of i
Min[0]=0

For i = 1 to S
For j = 0 to N - 1
   If (Vj<=i AND Min[i-Vj]+1<Min[i])
Then Min[i]=Min[i-Vj]+1

Output Min[S]
